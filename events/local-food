She started her traditional USUI Reiki training in 2007 and received her Master Reiki attunement in 2011, but has been an empath, mystic, psychic and healer all her life. Mindy says, \"Reiki changed my life and I want to bring that same happiness and joy to everyone. When I'm sharing energy healing with others I feel such joy and connection to everyone and everything. It is my calling and purpose in life to help others connect to their true soul selves which then connects us to each other and the source from which the life force energy comes\" <br \/>\n\n For more about Mindy and Shamanic Reiki, go to <a href=\"http:\/\/mindystates.wix.com\/shamanicreiki\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/mindystates.wix.com\/shamanicreiki<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Carrie States is a Reiki Master, Spiritual and Energetic Well-Being guide, Massage Therapist, and an Ordained Minister. She received her Level 1 attunement with her sister, Mindy, in 2007. Her passion is helping others and spreading peace and joy. She has taught numerous Reiki students and has had many Reiki circles over the years. As a Master Teacher of Reiki, Carrie knows that Reiki is already inside the student, and guides the student back to his or her alignment with the energy. <br \/>\n\n Carrie says, \"I found Reiki in 2007, and I knew immediately that was the energy healing I had already been connecting too. I actually had been drawing and painting the symbols for many years, in addition to working with the energy intuitively. I knew I was home; the indescribable feelings of unconditional love, joy, and peace were blissful. I was full of appreciation and gratitude for the privilege of sharing in this beautiful gift. My sister, Mindy, and I are committed to sharing Reiki and our other spiritual gifts, reaching as many people as we can to help them live more balanced physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual lives.\"<\/p>\n<p>About Homegrown: Homegrown is Orlando's only member-owned local food co-op focusing on locally and organically grown food. <br \/>\n\n Homegrown has been actively providing Central Floridians access to locally produced, organic and natural products since 2007.

Excellent opportunity to network in an informal format.<\/span> <br \/>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>This is a fantastic opportunity to get your portfolio in front of the people that make photography\/illustration buying decisions. <\/p>\n<p> You will have your portfolios reviewed by up to eight Designers, Art Directors and Creative Directors. <br \/>\n\n <span> You get five minutes of face-to-face time with each reviewer. <br \/>\n\n<\/span> <span> You get instant feedback <br \/>\n\n<\/span> <span> You get to ask questions and get answers <br \/>\n\n<\/span> <span> You can make connections for follow-up meetings <br \/>\n\n<\/span> <span> Afterward you can mix and mingle, get to know your reviewers and peers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>...all in one evening!<\/p>\n<p>To attend you MUST Pre-register at: <a href=\"http:\/\/capicportfoliospeedreview2013.eventbrite.com\/\">http:\/\/capicportfoliospeedreview2013.eventbrite.com\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Cost is $180 for non members to have the opportunity to have your portfolio reviewed, by experts in our industry, is worth the convenience for all involved. The cost to the members for the Portfolio Speed Review is $80, a saving of almost 25% towards the full membership fees for one year. It is a unique and special privilege, and well worth the convenience and everyones time. The evening has the potential to establish new business relationships, and launch careers into the right direction. It is really a win-win for attendees and participants.<\/p>\n<p>As an independent photographer trying to get your portfolio in front of 8 or more top art directors, designers and creative directors, as an alternative to the Portfolio Speed Review, you could spend hours on phone calls setting up appointments, having them cancelled and rescheduled, paying for parking, and, on and on. Everyones schedules are so busy, the Portfolio Speed Review is an efficient way to reach your potential clients! <\/p>\n<p>CAPIC board members, volunteers, reviewers, designers, suppliers and supporters spend literally hundreds of hours on your behalf to make this all happen for those who realize the value to their business. Reviews are done to help improve the industry, our members, and to bring our peers all together, as a benefit to everyone.<\/p>\n<p>You have the opportunity to meet and show your portfolio to the best in the city, all in one evening.

In fact, the atmospheric chemistry and surface physics of airborne particles and the biophysics of breathing have several things in common. In both cases, molecular organization is key in u<\/span><span>nderstanding the reactivity of their respective surfaces, and ultimately how particles affect climate change, and how the molecules of the alveolar lining play a key role in lung efficiency. She'll discuss state of the art laser instrumentation and provide some examples of how basic science lays down the fundamental understanding of such complex real world problems. <br \/>\n\n <br \/>\n\n Professor Allen received her B.S. degree in Chemistry in 1993 and Ph.D. in Physical Chemistry in 1997 at the University of California Irvine. As a student and postdoctoral researcher she was awarded several fellowships including Fannie and John Hertz, EPA, an NSF Traineeship, and a NOAA Post-Doctoral Fellowship in Climate and Global Change. At Ohio State she has been recognized for her research accomplishments with a Research Innovation Award from Research Corp. in 2001, an NSF CAREER Award in 2002, a Beckman Young Investigator Award in 2003, an Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellow Award in 2005, a Camille Dreyfus Teacher-Scholar Award in 2006, and a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in 2012, and, in 2013, the American Chemical Society National Award for Encouraging Women into Careers in the Chemical Sciences. She is a Full Professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry and in the Department of Pathology, and her research specialization is in molecular organization at interfaces.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><span>- If the weather is nice, we may eat outside at one of the taco trucks.
