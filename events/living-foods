He is a medical doctor, scientists, nutritionist and much more.  His credentials are extensive.  <br \/>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>Detoxification treatment has become one of the cornerstones of alternative medicine. It is based on the principle that illnesses can be caused by the accumulation of toxic substances (toxins) in the body. Detoxification treatments become necessary when the body's natural detoxification systems become overwhelmed. This can be caused by long-term effects of improper diet, stress, overeating, sedentary lifestyles, illness, drugs and alcohol, heavy metals, various chemicals such as pesticides, pollutants and food additives, and poor health habits in general. Eliminating existing toxins and avoiding new toxins are essential parts of the healing process.<\/p>\n<p>You Will Learn:<\/p>\n<p>1. Critical Sequential Pathways of Detoxification<\/p>\n<p>2. Nutrients Required to Support The Various Stages of Detoxification<\/p>\n<p>3. Mechanics of Moving the Toxins Safely Through The System<\/p>\n<p>4.
