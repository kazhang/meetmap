Hadoop is rapidly being adopted as a major platform for storing and managing massive amounts of data, and for computing descriptive and query types of analytics on that data. However, it has a reputation for not being a suitable environment for high performance complex iterative algorithms such as logistic regression, generalized linear models, and decision trees.<\/p>\n<p>This presentation will explain and demonstrate how to use R with Hadoop for high-performance analytics that scale.
