If you're not into the breakfast options, they have plenty of other items on their menu.<\/p>\n<p>I know I've said this before, but I'll say it again. Please do not RSVP unless you're sure you can attend. I like to keep the groups small, so if one person doesn't show up, they rob someone, who wants to attend, of the opportunity to join us. I know that sometimes things pop up that are beyond our control, but all I ask is that you be considerate. And if for some reason you must change you RSVP, that's no problem at all. Just make sure to do so in a timely matter so that those on the waiting list have ample time to respond and attend. <\/p>\n<p>* Cash only please -They don't accept credit cards.<\/p>\n<p>*Gluten-free options available.<\/p>\n<p>*I'm big on taking pictures.

But that leaves out some wonderful comfort foods like chillies, soups, and stews. Someone could bring bread\/rolls to accompany the dishes if desired. And don't forget desserts: puddings, tapioca, mousse, and runny lava cake.<\/p>\n<p>So, in this event, we will share food that belongs in bowls. It will be a great way to get ourselves in the mood for the upcoming winter. We could each bring two bowls. One would be for main food. Take a small sample of a soup or stew. Rinse out your bowl. Then try the next one! The other bowl would be for desserts. Same idea.<\/p>\n<p>What do you think? I love the idea.<\/p>\n<p>PS: One more idea: If the weather is good, I could get my Rocket Stove going to keep at least one soup pot warm. Ie, we could make this an indoor-outdoor event. And if others have Rocket Stoves, you could bring them. Don't know what a Rocket Stove is?
