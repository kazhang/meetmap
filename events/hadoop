We'd like to thank Tagged for hosting the event.<\/p>\n<p> <br \/>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>Spark 0.8 release<\/p>\n<p>Spark 0.8 is the biggest Spark release yet, as well as our first under Apache. With 68 developers and 20 companies contributing, this release adds a slew of new features. To make debugging and productionizing Spark jobs easier, we have a new monitoring UI and metrics infrastructure. To expand Spark's out-of-the-box capabilities, 0.8 adds MLlib, a standard library of high-quality machine learning algorithms. For Python users, PySpark has been greatly expanded to bring it near feature-parity with Scala, and now supports IPython and Windows. And for deployability, Spark 0.8 includes much-improved support for YARN, new EC2 scripts, and simpler packaging. This talk will give a tour of these and other new features. <br \/>\n\n <br \/>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>Spark at Bizo<\/p>\n<p>Bizo allows marketers target display campaigns to specific business demographic audiences, eg. people in finance or medicine; basically we help marketers get in front of the \"right people\". Part of the tooling we provide to customers is a reporting platform that has all kinds of fun shiny funnel charts stuffed with pretty metrics (seriously marketers love funnels even more than developers love free pizza). Recently we had to build some new reports that allow users to compare behavior of their website visitors based on whether or not visitors have been exposed to one of our display ads. This was a perfect opportunity for us to test out using Spark in production as it involved processing a fairly large amount of log data from multiple sources on a nightly basis. <\/p>\n<p>This talk will walk through how we're using Spark in production today on Amazon's EMR service. I'll cover how we've setup our installation &amp; deployment, how we structure our Spark jobs for easy unit testing, plus talk about how we put together a successful Spark hackday to get other engineering sub-teams at Bizo excited about using Spark. Finally I'll cover some common-pitfalls &amp; caveats we've encountered - especially with regards of translating some of our older Hive jobs to Spark &amp; how we go about debugging failed Spark jobs.  <br \/>\n\n <br \/>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>Doors open at 6:30, with talks starting at 7.<\/p>","name":"Spark 0.8 release and Spark at Bizo","headcount":0,"group":{"id":3138542,"group_lat":37.790000915527344,"name":"Spark User Meetup","group_lon":-122.41999816894531,"join_mode":"open","urlname":"spark-users","who":"Spark Enthusiasts"}},{"rsvp_limit":60,"status":"upcoming","visibility":"public","maybe_rsvp_count":0,"venue":{"id":15220282,"zip":"20191","lon":-77.335991,"repinned":false,"name":"Altamira","state":"VA","address_1":"1881 Campus Commons Dr #203","lat":38.94376,"city":"Reston","country":"us"},"id":"142259172","utc_offset":-14400000,"duration":7200000,"time":1380582000000,"waitlist_count":0,"updated":1380209222000,"yes_rsvp_count":40,"created":1380157973000,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/gdg-dc\/events\/142259172\/","description":"<p>This is a partner event with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/DC-JBug\/events\/128068042\/\">DC JBoss User Group Event<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Red Hat and Google are actively collaborating on a JBoss Community project called <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jboss.org\/capedwarf\">CapeDwarf<\/a>, which is a re-implementation of Google App Engines (GAE) APIs on Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform.<\/p>\n<p>This means that GAE apps can now be ported to Google Compute Engine, other clouds, and private infrastructures without modifications via Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform and OpenShift Enterprise by Red Hat.<\/p>\n<p>In this hands-on session, Ales Justin will present a real-life enterprise use case, showing how to take a Java application and move it from a traditional environment to both GAE (running on Googles cloud infrastructure) and OpenShift Enterprise running the GAE APIs through Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jboss.org\/capedwarf\">CapeDwarf<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p> <br \/>\n\n<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Google App Engine, Java, Google, JBoss, Redhat, Javascript, PaaS, Openshift","name":"Running Java Apps in Google App Engine & OpenShift via CapeDwarf - Partner Event","headcount":0,"group":{"id":1612017,"group_lat":38.93000030517578,"name":"Google Technology and Developer Group - Washington DC","group_lon":-77.4000015258789,"join_mode":"open","urlname":"gdg-dc","who":"Google Techies and Users"}},{"visibility":"public","status":"upcoming","maybe_rsvp_count":0,"venue":{"id":14215392,"lon":-79.995888,"repinned":false,"name":"ONLINE - WEBINAR","state":"PA","address_1":"Comfort of your Home or Office","lat":40.440624,"city":"Pittsburgh","country":"us"},"id":"141792312","utc_offset":-14400000,"time":1380643200000,"waitlist_count":0,"created":1379959388000,"yes_rsvp_count":12,"updated":1379959388000,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Pittsburgh-NoSQL-Group\/events\/141792312\/","description":"<p>Join Objectivity's Partner Cambrige Intelligence for: <\/p>\n<p>Free Google Hangout: Visualizing Graph Databases with KeyLines<\/p>\n<p> Do you struggle to find insight in your data?<\/p>\n<p> Is your graph database more of a mystery than an asset?<\/p>\n<p>If the answer to either of those is yes, then join us on Tuesday 01 October for our first ever <a href=\"http:\/\/keylines.us4.list-manage.com\/track\/click?u=ce6191c5e4fcba9f56261b78a&amp;id=06482d01d5&amp;e=a583a5be75\">Google Hangout<\/a> (its free!)<\/p>\n<p> <br \/>\n\nIn just half an hour, well show you how visualization technologies can help you extract insight from your data and add real value in your organization.<\/p>\n<p> <br \/>\n\nLed by visualization expert, Corey Lanum, the Hangout will then explain how you can use KeyLines to to quickly build powerful, professional and scalable visualization applications that can be deployed throughout the organization.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/keylines.com\/hangouts\"><img height=\"70\" src=\"https:\/\/gallery.mailchimp.com\/ce6191c5e4fcba9f56261b78a\/images\/Join_our_hangout.png\" width=\"146\" style=\"max-height : 700px ;

The focus of this talk is not your startup but you - its about and for the people behind successful companies. <br \/>\n\n <br \/>\n\n  How to be more productive, work reasonable hours and enjoy everyday tasks. <br \/>\n\n  How to get along better with your co-founders and employees and to build trust. Overcoming conflicts and competition inside the company, getting everyone involved in the product\/ business decisions without creating chaos. <br \/>\n\n  Why focusing on your users creates a motivated and happy team and how to do it right. <br \/>\n\n  What you can learn from professional athletes about losing and how improving your weakest point helps in increasing your happiness. <br \/>\n\n  The importance of a company culture and how it leads to a better performing group (and one that its fun to be a part) <\/p>\n<img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/1\/5\/a\/600_283924442.jpeg\" style=\"max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px\"><\/img> <br \/>\n\n<p><b>About the speaker:<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Co-founder and VP Product of Takipi, a start-up company solving one of cloud computing's toughest problems.
