Price, the man. You'll learn more about this fascinating figure, who traveled the world for most of the 1930s  able to visit indigenous peoples around the world, living as they had done for centuries, eating the diets that nourished their ancestors. He was able to compare those groups with groups of people nearby who had adopted a more modern diet, thanks to the development of ways to preserve nutritionally depleted foods that traveled well: condensed milk, jams and jellies, hardtack, and other \"displacing foods of modern commerce.\"<\/p>\n<p>There are tons of great photos, and even greater information  based on Price's observation of real people, eating real food (in contrast to lab rats consuming theoretical ratios of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates), who enjoyed real health. The book he wrote about the many journeys he took, and the 14 groups he identified as possessing outstanding health, is titled \"Nutrition and Physical Degeneration.\"<\/p>\n<p>It's fascinating stuff. <\/p>\n<p>This will be an entertaining, informative evening, and one that may well change how you think about food  for the better! <\/p>\n<p>There is never a charge to attend our Meetups, but we do rely on your donations to pay for meeting spaces, materials, DVDs, and many other things.

Author Wenonah Hauter demonstrates how the impacts ripple far and wide, from economic stagnation in rural communities at home, to famines in poor countries overseas. In the end, Hauter illustrates how solving this crisis will require a complete structural shift, a grassroots movement to reshape our food system from seed to table  a change that is about politics, not just personal choice.<\/p>\n<p>Learn more at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.foodopoly.org\/\">Foodopoly.org<\/a>!<\/p>\n<a class=\"embedded\" href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=oIBEY4ykTEU\">http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=oIBEY4ykTEU<\/a>\n<p><i>What others are saying:<\/i><\/p>\n<p><i>a meticulously researched tour de forceexamines the pernicious effects of consolidation in every sector of the food industry. - <a href=\"http:\/\/www.publishersweekly.com\/978-1-59558-790-9\">Publishers Weekly<\/a><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i>A forceful argument about our dysfunctional food system. -  <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kirkusreviews.com\/book-reviews\/wenonah-hauter\/foodopoly\/\">Kirkus Reviews<\/a><\/i><\/p>\n<p><b>ABOUT WENONAH HAUTER<\/b> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.foodopoly.org\/about-the-author\/\"> <br \/>\n\n<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.foodopoly.org\/about-the-author\/\">Wenonah Hauter<\/a> is the Executive Director of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.foodopoly.org\/about-food-water-watch\/\">Food &amp; Water Watch<\/a>, a national nonprofit organization working to ensure that our food, water and fish is safe to consume, is accessible and sustainably produced, and that our common resources are regulated in the public interestnot for private gain.
