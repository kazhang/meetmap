A few keywords to describe these family patterns gives us the keys to identify many thousands of plants. Once you can identify a daisy family plant, then 13,000 species (worldwide) in that family will potentially become knowable to you!<\/p>\n<p>After becoming acquainted with leaf shapes and some basic botanical terminology, we will take a forage walk round Mudchute, in to the park, taking in different habitats.<\/p>\n<p>For part 1 of the apprentices we will focus on the large Asteracea family of daisy's, sunflowers, and thistles, as well as the Rosaceae family of annuals, pernnials, shrubs and trees. (Members will need to have forwarded membership dues to receive location details and to attend)  Thanks in advance for your co-operation and understanding! <br \/>\n\n<\/p>\n<p> <br \/>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>Each of the families we cover are important ones for foragers. The daisy family provides us with a number of cultivated vegetables and long used wild plants. It is an extremely important plant family for diabetics, as the roots of plants such as Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosum), burdock (Arctium lappa), and dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) all contain the storage carbohydrate inulin, rather than starch. But is also largely untapped in terms of what could be used. Dhalia anyone?<\/p>\n<p>The rose family, ah...possibly the most evocative of all the plant families we have growing on these isles! Numerous fruits we eat everyday are from the rose, including cherry, peaches, apricots, almonds, plums, apples, pears, hawthorns, and raspberries, etc. Its a handy family for foragers to know because the plants are all edible. Now, tasty and edibility are different things, and notwithstanding you may have to cook certain plants...such as Rowan berries, to render them edible, they are almost all worth getting to know!<\/p>\n<p>As we stroll we will discuss the folklore and history of the plants encountered as well as their modern day uses and virtues. Most of our time will be spent with the plants, so no one should worry that we will walk very far!<\/p>\n<p>The information handouts are designed to supplement the information provided on the DVD.<\/p>\n<p>I look forward to seeing you there! <br \/>\n\n<\/p>\n<p> <br \/>\n\n<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Details of location will be sent on RSVP","name":"Foragers Apprentice Autumn Walk - Part 1 - Knowing Asteraceae & Rosaceae","headcount":0,"group":{"id":7918662,"group_lat":51.52000045776367,"name":"Wild food & Medicine Foraging Apprentice!","group_lon":-0.10000000149011612,"join_mode":"open","urlname":"Wild-food-and-medicine-Foraging-Apprentices","who":"Apprentice Foragers"}},{"status":"upcoming","visibility":"public","maybe_rsvp_count":0,"venue":{"id":12567632,"zip":"27510","lon":-79.077728,"repinned":false,"name":"Wild Food + Herb Market","state":"NC","address_1":"301 West Main Street","lat":35.911388,"city":"Carrboro","country":"us"},"id":"dlwmrfyrnbjb","utc_offset":-14400000,"duration":10800000,"time":1381078800000,"waitlist_count":0,"updated":1364777475000,"yes_rsvp_count":4,"created":1364777259000,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Raleigh-Forager-and-Wild-Crafting-Meetup\/events\/137874962\/","description":"<p><span>There is an excellent event being put on by The Abundance Foundation, the Wild Food + Herb Market happening once a month at the Carrboro Commons through November.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>I made this event a series until the event ends in November.
