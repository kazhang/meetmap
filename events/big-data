The talk will be preceded by a tea at 4:00pm.<\/p>\n<p>This talk will explore the world of big data in terms of how they are currently used by the Federal Statistical system and explore possible ways in which big data sources may be leveraged in the future.  In an era of declining real budgets for the Federal Statistical agencies, big data are often seen as an efficient and economical way to replace or supplement existing data collection programs.  However, the blending of existing Federal data series collected using established statistical survey practices with big data sources that are not necessarily representative samples of a larger universe frame poses some significant challenges to the Federal statistical system, especially in terms of the quality tradeoffs we may be making.  We also face challenges in maintaining our goal of methodological transparency when the potential biases of some big data sources are not always well understood.  The talk begins with an attempt to define big data.  I then present the results (to date) of an environmental scan we are conducting on the uses of big data across Federal statistical agencies as well as a scan of big data uses in academia and private business.  The remainder of the talk addresses the issue of the potential future uses of big data, developing a perspective based on existing frameworks for judging the quality of economic statistics as well as looking at the statistical issues associated with blending survey based data with big data sources.  I am particularly interested in your thoughts on the statistical issues and potential solutions to such issues posed by blended statistics.  I end the seminar with concluding thoughts on the future of big data in the Federal Statistical system based on my role as a Director of several major statistical survey programs.<\/p>\n<p>This talk reflects the current status of a project being sponsored by the American Economic Association Data Subcommittee on Big Data, for which I am a co-chair along with Ana Aizcorbe of the Bureau of Economic Analysis.  The goal of the project is to report on the current and potential uses of big data across the Federal Statistical system. <\/p>\n<p>The talk is part of the activities of the International Year of Statistics and is sponsored by the Departments of Mathematics and Statistics as well as Economics at Smith College and co-sponsored by the Five College Statistics Program and the Boston Chapter of the American Statistical Association.<\/p>\n<p>For more information about the talk, contact Katherine Halvorsen (<a href=\"mailto:khalvors@smith.edu\">khalvors@smith.edu<\/a>, 413-585-3874).

We'd like to thank Tagged for hosting the event.<\/p>\n<p> <br \/>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>Spark 0.8 release<\/p>\n<p>Spark 0.8 is the biggest Spark release yet, as well as our first under Apache. With 68 developers and 20 companies contributing, this release adds a slew of new features. To make debugging and productionizing Spark jobs easier, we have a new monitoring UI and metrics infrastructure. To expand Spark's out-of-the-box capabilities, 0.8 adds MLlib, a standard library of high-quality machine learning algorithms. For Python users, PySpark has been greatly expanded to bring it near feature-parity with Scala, and now supports IPython and Windows. And for deployability, Spark 0.8 includes much-improved support for YARN, new EC2 scripts, and simpler packaging. This talk will give a tour of these and other new features. <br \/>\n\n <br \/>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>Spark at Bizo<\/p>\n<p>Bizo allows marketers target display campaigns to specific business demographic audiences, eg. people in finance or medicine; basically we help marketers get in front of the \"right people\". Part of the tooling we provide to customers is a reporting platform that has all kinds of fun shiny funnel charts stuffed with pretty metrics (seriously marketers love funnels even more than developers love free pizza). Recently we had to build some new reports that allow users to compare behavior of their website visitors based on whether or not visitors have been exposed to one of our display ads. This was a perfect opportunity for us to test out using Spark in production as it involved processing a fairly large amount of log data from multiple sources on a nightly basis. <\/p>\n<p>This talk will walk through how we're using Spark in production today on Amazon's EMR service. I'll cover how we've setup our installation &amp; deployment, how we structure our Spark jobs for easy unit testing, plus talk about how we put together a successful Spark hackday to get other engineering sub-teams at Bizo excited about using Spark. Finally I'll cover some common-pitfalls &amp; caveats we've encountered - especially with regards of translating some of our older Hive jobs to Spark &amp; how we go about debugging failed Spark jobs.  <br \/>\n\n <br \/>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>Doors open at 6:30, with talks starting at 7.<\/p>","name":"Spark 0.8 release and Spark at Bizo","headcount":0,"group":{"id":3138542,"group_lat":37.790000915527344,"name":"Spark User Meetup","group_lon":-122.41999816894531,"join_mode":"open","urlname":"spark-users","who":"Spark Enthusiasts"}},{"visibility":"public","status":"upcoming","maybe_rsvp_count":0,"venue":{"id":15648522,"lon":-0.067536,"repinned":false,"name":"Erlang Solutions","address_1":"Suite 1.01, New Loom House, 101 Back Church Lane , E1 1LU London","lat":51.51276,"country":"gb","city":"London"},"id":"139442322","utc_offset":3600000,"time":1380562200000,"waitlist_count":0,"created":1378827070000,"yes_rsvp_count":43,"updated":1379509578000,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/riak-london\/events\/139442322\/","description":"<p>We have two things this month!<\/p>\n<p> <b>Riak and the Zombie Apocalypse!<\/b> (see below) <br \/>\n\n<\/p>\n<p> <b>Purifying the ring with salt:<\/b> Basho engineer Todd Tyree on using Yokozuna and Riak to get the best out of your data. <br \/>\n\n<\/p>\n<p><b>More on the Zombie Apocalypse:<\/b><\/p>\n<p>A deadly virus has broken out, causing zombie-like symptoms in sufferers.<\/p>\n<p>You are joining the Centre for Disease Control to help find a cure.
