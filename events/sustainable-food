She started her traditional USUI Reiki training in 2007 and received her Master Reiki attunement in 2011, but has been an empath, mystic, psychic and healer all her life. Mindy says, \"Reiki changed my life and I want to bring that same happiness and joy to everyone. When I'm sharing energy healing with others I feel such joy and connection to everyone and everything. It is my calling and purpose in life to help others connect to their true soul selves which then connects us to each other and the source from which the life force energy comes\" <br \/>\n\n For more about Mindy and Shamanic Reiki, go to <a href=\"http:\/\/mindystates.wix.com\/shamanicreiki\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/mindystates.wix.com\/shamanicreiki<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Carrie States is a Reiki Master, Spiritual and Energetic Well-Being guide, Massage Therapist, and an Ordained Minister. She received her Level 1 attunement with her sister, Mindy, in 2007. Her passion is helping others and spreading peace and joy. She has taught numerous Reiki students and has had many Reiki circles over the years. As a Master Teacher of Reiki, Carrie knows that Reiki is already inside the student, and guides the student back to his or her alignment with the energy. <br \/>\n\n Carrie says, \"I found Reiki in 2007, and I knew immediately that was the energy healing I had already been connecting too. I actually had been drawing and painting the symbols for many years, in addition to working with the energy intuitively. I knew I was home; the indescribable feelings of unconditional love, joy, and peace were blissful. I was full of appreciation and gratitude for the privilege of sharing in this beautiful gift. My sister, Mindy, and I are committed to sharing Reiki and our other spiritual gifts, reaching as many people as we can to help them live more balanced physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual lives.\"<\/p>\n<p>About Homegrown: Homegrown is Orlando's only member-owned local food co-op focusing on locally and organically grown food. <br \/>\n\n Homegrown has been actively providing Central Floridians access to locally produced, organic and natural products since 2007.

I have. On a summer night, in 2009 I sat in my parked car on a street in San Francisco attempting to gather up the courage to go into a networking event and talk to total strangers. I was terrified, stubborn and resistant. I started the car twice to leave. Only to turn it off, knowing I had to go meet new people if I wanted to succeed in my dreams. <br \/>\n\n After psyching myself up for 20 minutes, I finally walked into the event. I spent the next few hours hopelessly attempting to connect with people who didnt care who I was or the value I had to give.  I stumbled over my words, endured uncomfortable silences and felt simply miserable.<\/p>\n<p> <br \/>\n\n It was that night that vowed to never let that happen to me again. I learned all I could about networking skills, reading books and watching videos. I attended 2-3 events a week until I felt fully confident and comfortable at events. <br \/>\n\n Today, I can walk into a room and tell you exactly who the highest leverage people are. I can jump in and out of conversations with ease and keep conversations going long after the event is over.<\/p>\n<p> <br \/>\n\n From speaking to WCS members, a lack of confidence in networking skills is a main hindrance to their success in the field. That I why I have organized a monthly networking series, exclusive to WCS, is a way for you to learn these same skills in a controlled, safe environment first, then at a live cleantech networking setting that same night.  <br \/>\n\n You will learn the same techniques, tactics and tricks that the pros use to make networking, easy, fun and most of all effective.

This time, learn the differences between making an infusion and a decoction or a tincture and an extract. We will learn what liquids to use and which parts of the plants to use. <br \/>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>About the instructor:<\/p>\n<p>My name is Anne-Marie Bilella and I am The Farmer, The Baker and The Medicine-Maker at Bella Vista Farm in Monroe.<\/p>\n<p>I make herbal remedies and teach classes on bread making, herbal medicine and cooking. I LOVE teaching! It is so amazing when you can teach someone a new life skill and see how excited they are when they do it themselves!<\/p>\n<p>I garden and forage for wild foods, nothing crazyreally, just blackberries, muscadines, chickweed, dandelions, mushrooms, etc.<\/p>\n<p>Learning is a constant for me and my experience in herbal medicine continues to grow with each class I attend and each class I teach. I am currently studying under Patricia Kyritsi Howell of Wild Healing Herbs, BotanoLogos School of Herbal Studies and Rosemary Gladstars digital series.<\/p>\n<p>When I found out common plants like mint and chickweed could heal certain illnesses and they were pretty much free for the taking! I became obsessed with learning what every plant was and how it could be used, whether edible, medicinal or both.<\/p>\n<p>I especially love to make medicine and teach others how to do the same. Preventative herbal medicine too! Why wait until you have a problem. Plant walks are one of my favorite activities to id what is growing at my place or local parks or other people's farms.<\/p>\n<p>I live on a farm with my husband John and wonderful son, Jonathan! We have chickens, horses, cows, dogs and cats. Well, had cowsone went with a friend and one went in our freezer. More cows to come or maybe some pigs or goats!
