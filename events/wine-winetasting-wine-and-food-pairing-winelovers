His exquisitely balanced, food-driven, dry-style wines, grown on low-yielding slate and quartizite soil, give them a nuanced minerality, and are qual in quality to world famous Rheingau producers, such as Georg Breuer and Schloss Johannisberg, yet sold at a fraction of the price. The Ehrhard winery and cellar are part of a complex in the center of Rudesheim (a tourist town that draws 3.5 million visitors a year) that includes a restaurant and tasting room.<\/p>\n<p>The Gustave Lorentz winery, with a history extending back to 1836, is situated in the village of Bergheim in central Alsace. It remains a family winery, now in its sixth generation, and they currently have about 85 acres of vineyards on the hills of Altenberg de Bergheim, 4 acres planted on the hills of the Grand Cru Kanzlerberg and 30 acres in the Grand Cru Altenberg de Bergheim. The winery also purchases grapes from other vineyards, mainly in Bergheim. My visit to the winery was definetly the highlight of my Alsatian Wine Tour. Not just because they were so welcoming- we got there 2 hours after our scheduled appoiment!-note to myself- don't trust german GPS!- and giving us an extentive tour and tasting.
