Connected Car apps have arrived. All of the major car manufacturers are putting in place Connected Car strategies. Municipalities are looking to Connected Car apps to alleviate parking and traffic congestion. Insurance companies hope to tap the power of Connected Car apps to gain better insights into driver behavior and to deliver individualized policies.<\/p>\n<p>Innovative startups such as Dash aim to make it easier to own and take care of a car while also providing enhanced safety and connectivity at a lower cost. Large telcos and service providers are adding mobile data to cars, turning the freeways and cities into dense data hotspots with possibilities for mesh coverage supplanting traditional fixed wireless data delivery and opening up new entertainment and information options for car apps.<\/p>\n<p>This panel seeks to explore the future of the Connected Car through the lens of applications and answer three key questions: What is possible now, what does the future hold, and what are the new economics and likely use cases of the Connected Car.<\/p>\n<p><b>Confirmed Speakers:<\/b> <br \/>\n\n - <b>Alex Salkever<\/b>, Global Product Manager, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.telefonica.com\/en\/digital\/html\/silicon_valley\/home.shtml\">Telefonica<\/a> (moderator) <br \/>\n\n - <b>Matt Sweeney<\/b>, Engineering lead, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.uber.com\/\">Uber<\/a> <br \/>\n\n - <b>Kurt Buecheler<\/b>, SVP, Business Development, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.streetline.com\/\">Streetline<\/a> <br \/>\n\n - <b>TJ Giuli<\/b>, Research Lab Leader at <a href=\"http:\/\/fordsvl.com\/\">Ford Motor Company<\/a> <br \/>\n\n - <b>Laura Schewel,<\/b> Founder and CEO, <a href=\"http:\/\/streetlightdata.com\/\">StreetLight Data<\/a><\/p>\n<p><b>Agenda:<\/b> <br \/>\n\n 6:00-6:50pm: Registration and pre-party (with food &amp; beverages) <br \/>\n\n 6:50-7:15pm: Presentations <br \/>\n\n 7:15-8:00pm: Panel discussion <br \/>\n\n 8:00-8:30pm: Q&amp;A session <br \/>\n\n 8:30-9:00pm: Networking session<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/c\/1\/4\/600_284984052.jpeg\" style=\"max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px\"><\/img><\/p>","name":"Uber, Ford, Telefonica & Others Discuss Connected Car Apps","headcount":0,"group":{"id":5918982,"group_lat":37.439998626708984,"name":"The Hive Big Data Think Tank","group_lon":-122.1500015258789,"join_mode":"open","urlname":"SF-Bay-Areas-Big-Data-Think-Tank","who":"Data Bees"}},{"status":"upcoming","visibility":"public","maybe_rsvp_count":0,"venue":{"id":15342362,"zip":"90401","lon":-118.488945,"repinned":false,"name":"Cross Campus","state":"CA","address_1":"820 Broadway Santa Monica, CA 90401","lat":34.018742,"city":"Santa Monica","country":"us"},"id":"141187212","utc_offset":-25200000,"duration":117900000,"time":1380814200000,"waitlist_count":0,"updated":1380138417000,"yes_rsvp_count":3,"created":1379632151000,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BIGG-DATA-COM\/events\/141187212\/","description":"<p>The LA Area Chamber's Bixel Exchnage, a technology center that is focused on providing events, services and mentorship programs for the tech community in LA, is working with SAP to produce an event on October 3-4th (location TBD by tomorrow, likely on the Westside).<\/p>\n<p>The SAP Startup Product Forum is a 2-day program to engage big data, predictive data, and real-time data startups and programmers and introduce them to the In-Memory Hana platform.<\/p>\n<p>There have been over 55 of these programs that have been launched globally and this is the first in Los Angeles.
