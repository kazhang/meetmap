All he did was give himself the permission to change the game.<\/p>\n<p>He has gone on to start other game changing startups like hipmunk and breadpig, while also doing his part to fight for internet users rights while investing and advising startups. Alexis also represents the Y Combinator family so he brings lessons and skills from some of the most successful entrepreneurs out there.<\/p>\n<p>Bosses don't wait for permission to create; they create and deal with the outcomes later.
